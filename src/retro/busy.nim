## Work that takes a while, on the thread that draws: the hook through
## which long loops keep the window alive. After a moment a box comes up
## with an animation (and a Cancel), the screen is kept drawn and the
## system's events read (a phone does not think the app hangs); Esc or
## Cancel asks the work to stop.
##
## Long loops call `busyTick()` now and then (`parallelFor` does it while
## it waits for the cores); `retro/core` sets what it does. Work that can
## be stopped is marked with `beginBusy(label, cancel = true)` ...
## `endBusy()`: a tick then raises `BusyCancelled` once Cancel was pressed,
## at a point where nothing is half written (an undo step is there to take
## back what was done).
